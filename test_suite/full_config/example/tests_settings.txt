# Namelist configuration:
# Placeholder ids can be grouped so that they will be varied simultaneously across testing
#
# "varpergroup" contains a list of integers
# The length of the list specifies the number of placeholder groups
# For each group an integer specified the size of this group
#
# After "varpergroup" a whitespace should be placed
# Then, for each group, one specifies:
#       -The IDs of the placeholders
#       -The reference names for the values to be substituted, any amount of values may be substituted at the placeholder values
#        The separator for the substitutions should be the '|' character
#       -One line for each placeholder, with the values to be substituted
#
# For example, we have two placeholder ids: "ex" and "ex2"
# These correspond to the placeholders "@EX@" and  "@EX2@" in the namelist template
# We want to substitute simultaneously three values of ex ("1 ", " 2 ", "3x") and ex2 ("he", "he2,he3", "1")
# The reference names of these three values are "A", "B" and "C".
#
# Then the placeholder group should be specified as
#ex ex2
#A B C
#1 | 2 |3x
#he|he2,he3|1
#
# In the "varpergroup" field, a "2" should be added since this placeholdergroup consists of two placeholders
# This group should be placed one whitespace apart from the previous placeholder group (or from varpergroup if it is represented by
the first integer in the "varpergroup" field
# the ordering of the integers of varpergroup must be consistent.
